# Getting-started-with-Reinforcement-Learning

This is an introduction to Reinforcement Learning using Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning.

## 1. Q Learning
   Q Learning is demonstrated using OpenAI's Frozen Lake Environment. You can read more about the envrionment [Here](https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/).
   #### RL concepts used: 
   1. Markov Decision Process and it's components i.e. The Agent, Environment, State, Action, Reward 
   2. Expected Discounted Return (Discount Rate)
   3. Epsilon-Greedy Strategy
   4. Bellman Optimality Equation (Optimal policy, Optimal Q function, Learning Rate)
   
## 2. Deep Q-Learning
   DQN is demonstrated using OpenAI's Cart Pole Environment. You can read more about the envrionment [Here](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/).
   #### RL concepts used besides the ones stated above: 
   1. Artificial Neural Network Architecture
   2. Experience Replay
   3. Training and Target Networks
