# Getting-started-with-Reinforcement-Learning

This is an introduction to Reinforcement Learning using Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning.

1. Q Learning
   Q Learning is demonstrated using OpenAI's Frozen Lake Environment. You can read more about the envrionment on [Here](#https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/)
   RL concepts used in code: - Markov Decision Process and it's components i.e. The Agent, Environment, State, Action, Reward <br>
                             - Expected Discounted Return (Discount Rate)
                             - Epsilon-Greedy Strategy
                             - Bellman Optimality Equation (Optimal policy, Optimal Q function, Learning Rate)
2. Deep Q-Learning
   DQN is demonstrated using OpenAI's Cart Pole Environment.
