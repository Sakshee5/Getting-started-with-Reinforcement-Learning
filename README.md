# Getting-started-with-Reinforcement-Learning

This is an introduction to Reinforcement Learning using Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning.

### 1. Q Learning
   Q Learning is demonstrated using OpenAI's Frozen Lake Environment. You can read more about the envrionment on [Here](#https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/)
   #### RL concepts used in code: 
   1. Markov Decision Process and it's components i.e. The Agent, Environment, State, Action, Reward <br>
   2. Expected Discounted Return (Discount Rate)
   3. Epsilon-Greedy Strategy
   4. Bellman Optimality Equation (Optimal policy, Optimal Q function, Learning Rate)
   5. 
### 2. Deep Q-Learning
   DQN is demonstrated using OpenAI's Cart Pole Environment.
